Crystal Collector

This game was designed using javascript to create a functional numbers matching game.

Upon loading the page, the code randomly generates a number for the computer to play.
Each of the crystals are assigned randomly generated numbers that are hidden from the user. It is up to the user to click the crystals to discover their value. The goal of the game is to match the total of crystals clicked to the number selected by the computer.
If you go over the computers number you lose. If you match it, you win.

Once the user has won or lost a game the game starts over and new numbers are generated and assigned to the computer player as well as the crystals.

The visuals for this game were designed using Bootstrap.
